Introduction:This project aims to build a convenient and effective online badminton court booking platform for both players and court managers. This platform will help players easily find a course that suits their needs, book a playing schedule, pay online and track booking history. At the same time, the platform also helps yard managers manage yard information, schedules, employees, and revenue and expenditure effectively.
